This is a list of all the hints that can be in the filename of a texture in
Stepmania.

* Sprite frames  
	Sprite frame hints are two numbers separated by 'x' that tell Stepmania
	how many columns and rows of sprite frames the texture contains.  
	Example:  16x16  
	This tells Stepmania that the texture is split into frames, with 16 frames
	on each row and 16 rows.  So a texture that is 320x224 in size and has the
	16x16 hint in its filename is split into frames that are 20x14.
